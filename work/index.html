            <p>After working in network security, I started doing research in
               the field of Educational Data Mining under
               <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tmbarnes/">Dr. Tiffany Barnes</a>
               and <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~efg">Dr. Edward Gehringer</a>.
               Educational Data Mining is the application of data mining and
               machine learning techiques to associate data from educational
               environments such as classrooms and tutoring systems and
               with learning and engagement.</p>
            <p>While working in the CEI, I had the opportunity to engage in a
               teaching-intensive program, teaching classes for nearly two years.
               Teaching has tremendously improved my communication skills.
               Having to lecture twice a week has made me a much better public
               speaker, and holding office hours for my students has helped me
               listen to and troubleshoot their technical difficulties.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed scripts in Python for the analysis of tutoring
                  system logs and student source code, and packaged data and
                  source code from research into <strong>replication
                  packages</strong> to facilitate reproduction of results by
                  other researchers.</li>
              <li>Acted as the lab system administrator, managing our research
                  server and writing Ajax scripts to collect data from web-based
                  tutoring systems.</li>
              <li>Taught undergraduate classes for two years. I was the lab
                  instructor for the junior-level <strong>Software
                  Engineering</strong> course that taught agile principles
                  through a semester-long web app development project, and
                  co-instructor for the sophomore-level <strong>C &amp; Software
                  Tools</strong> course that teaches the C programming language,
                  version control, debugging, and automation.</li>
              <li>Implemented the Github flow into my sophomore-level <strong>C
                  &amp; Software Tools</strong> course, and built an automated
                  grading system that utilize Jenkins continuous integration to
                  provide immediate feedback on homework grades to students and
                  instructors.</li>
              <li>Received numerous accolades for teaching, including the
                  <strong>Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching</strong>, the
                  <strong>Preparing the Professoriate Fellowship</strong>, and nomination
                  for the <strong>Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award</strong> for both
                  years of my work - winning the award in the second year.</li>

            <p>After completing my B.Sc. in Computer Science, I started graduate
               school in the <strong>Cyber Defense Lab</strong> working under
               <a href="http://discovery.csc.ncsu.edu">Dr. Peng Ning</a>.
               I did research on network security analytics focused on the
               relationships of services in distributed networks. This work
               was used as the basis for my M.Sc. in Computer Science, completed
               in May 2013.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implemented <a href="http://openbts.org">OpenBTS</a> on the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral">USRP</a>

                  base station attack</a> in a lab environment.</li>
              <li>Developed a Python software package and library around
                  <a href="http://github.com/isharacomix/nsdminer"><em>NSDMiner</em></a>,
                  a non-intrusive algorithm for detecting network service
                  dependencies in distributed systems.</li>
              <li>Worked with the NC State University Office of Technology
                  Transfer to release the <em>NSDMiner</em> source code under an
                  open source license.</li>
              <li>Published and presented my work on <em>NSDMiner</em> at

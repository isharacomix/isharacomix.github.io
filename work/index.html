            <p>I'm currently working in the <strong>Office of the CTO</strong> at
               <a href="http://cumulusnetworks.com">Cumulus Networks</a>, a networking
               startup based in Mountain View, CA. Cumulus Networks develops and licenses
               a version of Linux designed to run on white-box switches, making
               hardware accelerated switching accessible without having to learn a custom
               operating system. Because the interface is "just Linux", it's possible to
               leverage the same automation and monitoring tools used for managing Linux-based
               servers, unifying the system administration experience for the entire infrastructure.
               I work on prototyping integrations and developing demos with other vendors in the
               webscale networking space.
            </p>
            <p>
               I've worked in several capacities at Cumulus, starting as a <strong>Customer Engineer</strong>
               in the Enablement team, where I developed the Cumulus Workbench, a web application for
               provisioning physical labs for customers and students to test-drive the platform. I then
               worked as a <strong>Consulting Engineer</strong> in the Consulting team, where I leveraged
               Vagrant and the Cumulus VX virtual machine to develop demos of the platform's features and
               integration potential. I also migrated training away from the legacy hardware of the physical
               workbench and developed a virtual workbench to take its place.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed and supported the Workbench, a distributed system built with

              <li>Deployed and maintained a hybrid cloud of virtual machines hosted in

            <p>Through most of graduate school, I did research in the field of
               Educational Data Mining as a <strong>Teaching &amp; Research Assistant</strong>
               working under
               <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tmbarnes/">Dr. Tiffany Barnes</a>
               and <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~efg">Dr. Edward Gehringer</a>.
               Educational Data Mining is the application of data mining and
               machine learning techiques to associate data from educational
               environments such as classrooms and tutoring systems and
               with learning and engagement.</p>
            <p>While working in the CEI, I had the opportunity to engage in a
               teaching-intensive program, teaching classes for nearly two years.
               Teaching has tremendously improved my communication skills.
               Having to lecture twice a week has made me a much better public
               speaker, and holding office hours for my students has helped me
               listen to and troubleshoot their technical difficulties.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed scripts in Python for the analysis of tutoring
                  system logs and student source code, and packaged data and
                  source code from research into replication
                  packages to facilitate reproduction of results by
                  other researchers.</li>
              <li>Acted as the lab system administrator, managing our research
                  server and writing Ajax scripts to collect data from web-based
                  tutoring systems.</li>
              <li>Taught undergraduate classes for two years. I was the lab
                  instructor for the junior-level <emSoftware
                  Engineering</em> Software course that taught agile principles
                  through a semester-long web app development project, and
                  co-instructor for the sophomore-level <em>C &amp; Software
                  Tools</em> course that teaches the C programming language,
                  version control, debugging, and automation.</li>
              <li>Implemented the Github flow into my sophomore-level <em>C
                  &amp; Software Tools</em> course, and built an automated
                  grading system that utilize <a href="http://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a>
                  continuous integration to
                  provide immediate feedback on homework grades to students and
                  instructors.</li>
              <li>Received numerous accolades for teaching, including the
                  <em>Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching</em>, the
                  <em>Preparing the Professoriate Fellowship</em>, and nomination
                  for the <em>Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award</em> for both
                  years of my work - winning the award in the second year.</li>
              <li>Published <a href="http://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2014/uploads/procs2014/long%20papers/92_EDM-2014-Full.pdf">papers</a>
                  as well as a <a href="https://www.hastac.org/blogs/barrypeddycordiiiandelizabethapitts/2013/08/01/chapter-two-open-programming-open-learning">book
                  chapter</a> on my research through open access channels.</li>

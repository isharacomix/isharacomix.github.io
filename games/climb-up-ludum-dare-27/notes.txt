Here's what's almost guaranteed to be the problem:
OAM DMA is started too late (without enough time for it to finish before rendering starts). One should usually start OAM DMA immediately at the beginning of NMI, even though that means the screen's contents are late by up to 1/60th of a second.

Here's some other minor things I noticed on a cursory look-through:

One should read PPUSTATUS once before vblankwait1, so that it does the right thing on a warm reboot.
The reset code prepares the $0300 page for OAM, but later on $0700 is used. (This causes a pile of sprites to appear at 0,0)
FRAMECTRL isn't at $4018, it's at $4017. (I suppose this could possibly cause an infinite loop, maybe?)
IRQ should probably point at RESET, not at 0 (or else an explicit "acknowledge and disable IRQ sources")
The game's level designs use all 240 scanlines, of which the top and bottom ~12 won't be visible on an actual TV.
Player can 'stick' to the underside of platforms/ceiling by holding jump.
The header should probably not specify 4-screen mirroring.
The anonymous and reused bare zero-page addresses make me suspicious.

About this site
===============
This website has been on the internet since as far back as about 2006, when it was first created to host my webcomic series *Ishara Comix*. Since its inception, it's been through several overhauls from a webcomic to a traditional long-form blog until it ended up essentially being a virtual business card pointing people to Twitter and other websites where I had started doing the bulk of my writing.

Long-form blogs are fun, but thanks to the growing popularity of microblogging platforms and the ever-shrinking attention span of the average website visitor, I've started reconsidering the purpose of the programmer's professional website as more of a portfolio where I *show* people the kinds of things I'm working on instead of just *talking* about them.

On that note, I introduce the  newest incarnation of my site as an *Interactive Blog/Open Workshop* where instead of chronologically talking about my personal feelings on any given day, I show a snapshot of some little thing I've figured out how to build with a long-form description of what it is, how it works, and what it means. For example, I've been interested in retro video game consoles for a long time, and I've been learning how to write [Nintendo Entertainment System][] and [Game Boy][] games in assembly code using open source assemblers and emulators. So in this blog, I showcase what I call **[demos][]**, which are tiny, interactive proofs of concept of the things I learn how to do. In addition to the demos, I also hope to host some full-fledged **[games][]** of my own and even some **[tutorials][]** on how to make these kinds of things yourself.


 It has gone through multiple iterations from a webcomic to a traditional long-form blog


This site was established way back in about 2006 to host my then-fledgling webcomic *Ishara Comix*

I've had this website since about 2006 where I used to run a webcomic called *Ishara Comix*
I've been blogging since about 2008,


 and since finally picking up the whole microblogging thing on sites like Twitter, I've found that writing long form isn't personally satisfying

This website serves as my portfolio and public workshop, where I show off the things I enjoy working on while I'm still working on them. For example, this year, I've been teaching myself how to write in assembly code for the [Nintendo Game Boy][]. The site is broken up into **demos** (small, interactive works-in-progress), **games**

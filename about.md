About this site
===============
This website has been on the internet since as far back as about 2006, when it was first created to host my webcomic series *Ishara Comix*. Since its inception, it's been through several overhauls from a webcomic to a traditional long-form blog until it ended up essentially being a virtual business card pointing people to Twitter and other websites where I had started doing the bulk of my writing.

Long-form blogs are fun, but thanks to the growing popularity of microblogging platforms and the ever-shrinking attention span of the average website visitor, I've started reconsidering the purpose of the programmer's professional website as more of a portfolio where I *show* people the kinds of things I'm working on instead of just *talking* about them.

On that note, I introduce the  newest incarnation of my site as an **Interactive Blog/Open Workshop** where instead of chronologically talking about my personal feelings on any given day, I show a snapshot of some little thing I've figured out how to build with a long-form description of what it is, how it works, and what it means. For example, I've been interested in retro video game consoles for a long time, and I've been learning how to write [Nintendo Entertainment System][] and [Game Boy][] games in assembly code using open source assemblers and emulators. So in this blog, I showcase what I call **[demos][]**, which are tiny, interactive proofs of concept of the things I learn how to do. Over time, I also hope to host some full-fledged **[games][]** of my own and even some **[tutorials][]** on how to make these kinds of things yourself.

About me
========
My name is **Barry Peddycord III**, and above all else, I enjoy learning how machines work. Classically trained as a computer scientist with a focus on software engineering, my personal interests revolve around how the abstract software and physical hardware work together to do things we take for granted. I'm as comfortable with Python as I am with C and Assembly, and enjoy working at all levels of computing - especially when it involves finding out something new.

Most programmers would probably shudder at the fact that my idea of a good time is triple-checking a microcontroller's spec sheet to avoid frying my components on a breadboard. I like taking things apart to seeing how they fit together, and to see if there's a way I can tweak it so that it does something new when I put it back (assuming I haven't broken it in the process). Some of my favorite toys include my [Raspberry Pi][] and [Arduino][], and if I had more money, I might even try my hand at auto mechanics.

I run Linux, to which I owe everything I know about computing to the yearly catastrophic crashes that taught me how to not get worked up over technical difficulties. I like to stretch things to their limits, using a Github Pages blog written in Jekyll as an interactive blog featuring retro video game emulators and other toys and trinkets. When I'm truly offline, I take my passion for experimentation and engineering to the kitchen where I play around with food and usually end up with edible results.

You can keep up with me and my nonsense on [Twitter][], [Github][], and [LinkedIn][].

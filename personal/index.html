            <p>I started attending North Carolina State University for Computer
               Science in August of 2008, and completed two degree programs
               (B.Sc. '11, M.Sc. '13).</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate career, I was involved in research with
               <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/mfms/">Dr. Matt Stallmann</a>
               in the experimental evaluation of algorithms. I implemented and
               benchmarked classical and modified algorithms for minimum spanning
               trees and ran them against large data sets to measure their
               performance.</p>
            <p>For my undergraduate senior design project, I developed a real-time
               operating system that exposed a serial interface for interacting
               with a custom robot platform. The OS was written in C for the PIC
               microcontroller, and interfaced with a Java API that I provided
               to the rest of my team to develop for the platform.</p>

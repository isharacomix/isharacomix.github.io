What you see here is an honest-to-goodness *"Hello World"* program running in a *[Game Boy][]* emulator written in Javascript. Welcome to the first entry of what I've decided to start calling my **interactive blog**.

Ironically, the *"Hello World"* program featured here is actually not interactive. The program comes straight from a [tutorial][] on *Game Boy* game development, and simply creates a pattern table that it uses to write the text "Hello World" to the background - bugs and all. However, this entry is not just a *"Hello World"* in the most obvious sense, it's also a *"Hello World"* of sorts for the engine powering this interactive blog.

The purpose of the *"Hello World"* is to create the minimum proof of concept necessary to begin exploring a new platform. This might literally be typing the text "Hello World" to the screen. It might be playing a sound or drawing a circle. It might be flashing an LED on a breadboard with an Arduino. Even in a familiar environment or language, we find ourselves making very simple *"Hello Worlds"* when we encounter new features, libraries, and frameworks. These little prototypes are the foundation of the tinkerer's way of learning how the world works. It's not about simulating life or anthropomorphizing the device - it's about **stimulating understanding by managing complexity**.

So in a sense, I've planned for this newest iteration of my blog to be little more than a collection of *"Hello World"* prototypes, starting with the *Game Boy*. There's a lot I don't understand, such as how to accomplish bank switching and how to write to persistent battery-backed RAM. I might not know how to do these off the top of my head, but I do know exactly how I plan to learn them: by writing a prototype. What better way to demonstrate the creative process than showing off these prototypes, these proofs of concepts, these **[demos][]**?

Check back every once in a while to see what I'm up to. It should be a fun ride.

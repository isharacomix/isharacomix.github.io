Demos
=====
The main feature of this blog are my **demos**: incomplete game-like artifacts that exhibit either technical proofs of concept or examples of simple game mechanics expressed in assembly code. Each page includes an interactive emulator written in javascript so that you can try out the demo without having to install anything, but also includes links to a downloadable version and the source code so that you can explore it on your own system if the Javascript version doesn't work for some reason.

If you want to play something more complete, visit the **[games][]** library.
